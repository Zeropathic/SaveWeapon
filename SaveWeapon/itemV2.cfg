title = "Save Weapon BETA (Give Weapon supplement)";
description = "Automatically saves items created with the GiveWeapon mod and loads them into your inventory next time you launch the game. This mod is in beta and is still being worked on, but the core features mentioned should be functional.

Should be compatible with Loadout Manager and Weapon Kill Counter.

You can mark created items as favorites (hover and press F), and the mod will remember when it loads.

Command list:
 - /sw_save_%item_name% (saves a specified unsaved item, useful if auto-save is off - start typing and auto-fill will help you)
 - /sw_delete_last (deletes last saved item)
 - /sw_delete_%item_name% (deletes specified item - auto-fill will show options when you start typing)
 - /sw_undo (undoes the last deletion in case you messed up)

Data is saved in: /Users/YourNameHere/AppData/Roaming/Fatshark/Vermintide 2/user_settings.config
Open in a text editor and search/ctrl+f for \"saved_items\" to find the entries, should you want to.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to put this mod after the required items in your mod loader.
