title = "Save Weapon BETA (Give Weapon supplement)";
description = "Automatically saves items created with the GiveWeapon mod and loads them into your inventory next time you launch the game. This mod is in beta and is still being worked on, but the core features mentioned should be functional.

You can mark created items as favorites (hover and press F), and the mod will remember when it loads.

Currently the only way to delete saved items is to remove them manually from the .config file. 
To do so, open this file:
/Users/YourNameHere/AppData/Roaming/Fatshark/Vermintide 2/user_settings.config

... in a text editor and search/ctrl+f for \"saved_items\". 
The entries are intuitively named and it's easy to find the right one. Simply select the line and delete it.
NOTE: Deleting might be unreliable if your game is running, due to the way the .config file is handled. For reliable results, delete while your game is closed.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to put this mod after the required items in your mod loader.
