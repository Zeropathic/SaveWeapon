title = "Save Weapon BETA (Give Weapon supplement)";
description = "Saves items created with the GiveWeapon mod and loads them into your inventory next time you launch the game.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to put this mod after the required items in your mod launcher.

Compatible with the Loadout Manager and Weapon Kill Counter mods, and also supports inventory favorites (hover an item and press F).

Chat commands are included to offer some control over saved items.

Command list:
 - /sw_save_%item_name% (saves a specified unsaved item, useful if auto-save is off - start typing and auto-fill will help you)
 - /sw_delete_last (deletes last saved item)
 - /sw_delete_%item_name% (deletes specified item - auto-fill will show options when you start typing)
 - /sw_undo (undoes the last deletion in case you messed up)

Data is saved in: /Users/YourNameHere/AppData/Roaming/Fatshark/Vermintide 2/user_settings.config
Open in a text editor and search/ctrl+f for \"saved_items\" to find the entries, should you want to.
